####  Documentation
  * in your README, write documentation for you data structures
  * your documentation should includes code block useage examples
  * provide instructions for:
    * installing and using your data structure
    * accessing each method
    * running your tests

### Documentation
  * let blah = new List ();   to create a new empty array
  * List.push(...args) takes in multiple arguments and will add those items to the end of the array and increase the length accordingly
  * List.pop() takes in no arguments, and will return to you the last item in the array and decrease length by 1
  * List.forEach(callback) takes a callback function as the argument and will run that callback once for every item in the array
  * List.filter(callback) takes a callback and if the array items pass the criteria in the callback it will then be pushed into the new array that is returned to you
  * List.map(callback) takes a callback and will run that callback on each array item and then return to you a completely new mutated array
  * List.reduce(callback, initVal) will combine all array items based on the callback and the given initial value
